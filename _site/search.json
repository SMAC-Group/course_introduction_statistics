Nous explorons les r√®gles √©l√©mentaires permettant de quantifier l‚Äôincertitude et d‚Äôassocier une probabilit√© √† divers √©v√©nements. Le deuxi√®me axe est consacr√© aux statistiques descriptives. L‚Äôobjectif est ici de r√©sumer et de visualiser un √©chantillon de donn√©es afin d‚Äôen faciliter l‚Äôinterpr√©tation. Enfin, le troisi√®me axe traite de la statistique inf√©rentielle. Nous utilisons des mod√®les statistiques pour formuler des hypoth√®ses et prendre des d√©cisions √† partir d‚Äôun √©chantillon de donn√©es.\nLe contenu pr√©sent√© sur ce site a √©t√© principalement d√©velopp√© par St√©phane Guerrier, Mucyo Karemera, Samuel Orso et Lionel Voirol."
